        job? <br> <strong> 2. What will I achieve if I learn this skill? </strong> <br> Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your work hours, work remotely and travel more? <br> <strong> 3. How will this skill
        change my life and my career? </strong> Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill? Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?<br> <strong> 4. How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family
        , friends and coworkers?</strong> What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt this skill? How will it change the way they think of you? Will your coworkers respect you more? <br> <strong> 5. How will I feel if I never accomplish
